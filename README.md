# horiseon-site-accessibility-updates

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to update the Horiseon site to meet accessibility standards and to clean up the code present. Moreover, I was motivated to create greater functionality in the code so the website could run more smoothly. While I did not build the original project, I built upon the existing code and worked to make the website better in terms of both functionality and accessibility. Additionally, I built upon this website in order to meet best practices of web design for the page. This project solves issues that were present in the Horiseon site prior to the work I did on the page. Previously, the Horiseon site did not have image descriptions that upheld accessibility standards. Furthermore, the html file had minimal semantic elements and was full of divs. The html file also included links that were broken, and both the html and CSS files lacked logical flow and consolidation. I updated the site to meet accessiblity standards by adding image descriptions in html, changed the divs to semantic elements in html to make it easier to read, created functionality to the links in the navigation element of the webpage, and updated both the html and CSS files to be consolidated and have a logical flow. When looking at the updated site, it is evident that there are descriptions attatched to the images and the links are functioning correctly. Moreover, upon looking at the html and CSS files it is clear that semantic elements are in place rather than divs, and that the CSS file matches the new semantic html elements and is consolidated to provide clarity as well. Lastly, I provided comments to the CSS file which explain how those classes effect the elements on the webpage. Throughout this project, I learned new semantic elements for html such as the nav element for navigation bars. I also learned how to properly link elements on a webpage, allowing the user to click on an element in the navigation bar and jump to the associated point on the webpage. I also learned how to consolidate CSS classes for elements that are attributed the same styling. 

## Usage
To use this website, click on one of the links in the navigation bar. These links are Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. Upon clicking on one of these links, you will be taken to the location on the webpage associated with that link. You can also simply scroll down the page to see the various sections and their content.
